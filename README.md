Basic example of a Snake game, using tkinter as it's graphics library.
The game runs with builtin python modules only, no externals are needed.

The purposes of this projects are:
- entertainment
- testing tkinter as a basic game engine
- testing a basic game engine architecture

Conclusions so far:
- tkinter is not good for making games
- python is very good for learning game developlent
- python is good for simple 2D games
- the current game engine structure is very good for simple 2D games
